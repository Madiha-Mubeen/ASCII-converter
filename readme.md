## ASCII-Converter
This is an good looking, interactive web app tool that lets the user convert between the characters and with their ASCII, Binary, Hexadecimal, or can be Octal values. Main theme I have implied is eye-attracting Matrix-style background, theme-toggle and smooth animations for a modern feel!

## Features I have Added 
<b>
- Character to Values
- Values to Character
- Click to copy
- Theme (light or Dark as user prefers)
- Matrix Rain Animation
- ASCII Tables
- Button click sound
</b>

## How Can Someone Use ???
1 (Source): Character to Values
    - Type a single character (.e.g. M) in the first input box.
    - Click Convert! to see values of all.
2 (Source): ASCII Table
    - Scroll or be searched for characters by value, binary, octal, or hexadecimal.
    - Table header stays sticky with transparent view for easy reference.


# Technologies OR Languages I have Implied 
<b> HTML5 
^ CSS 
^ JavaScript 
^  Canvas API 
^ LocalStorage (for remembering theme preference)
</b>

## Difficulties I faced:
While builting this project I mostly faced difficulties with JavaScript, then how and what kind of theme I should Add, how can I make this website useful/helpful for others !!
